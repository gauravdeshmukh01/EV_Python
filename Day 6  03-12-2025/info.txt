File Handling in Python

Two Types of files:
text file 
binary file => (won't be in the readable format e.g images)


File operation:
open
read
write
close


f1=open("file_1.txt","x")
x == Mode


Six types of modes:

r  - read

w  - write (opens the file in write mode only. It overwrites the file if it already
     exists or creates a new file if the file does not exist. The file handler 
     exists at the beginning.)

a  - append (opens the file in append/write mode. The file handler exists at the end.)


r+  ==> opens the file in both read and write mode. File handler exists at the 
        beginning of the file. I/O error if file does not exist.

w+  ==> opens the file in both read and write mode. It creates a new file if it 
        does not exist or overwrites an existing file. File handler is at the end of file.

a+  ==> opens the file in both read and write mode. File handler exists at the end 
        of the file. Creates a new file if it does not exist.
