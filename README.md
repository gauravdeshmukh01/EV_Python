## What is Python?

**Python** is a high-level, open-source, and interpreted **programming language** used for software development, automation, data processing, web development, and enterprise systems. It is widely known for:

- **Simple and readable syntax**
- **Fast development speed**
- **Large standard library**
- **Cross-platform compatibility**
- **Strong support for backend and automation development**

This makes Python ideal for use in real-world enterprise applications, including those developed in the Finacle ecosystem.
